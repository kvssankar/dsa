Give me precise system design ans in the below format:  
  
1. Functional requirements:(abstract methods)  
  
  
2. Non funtional requirements  
  
  
3. Key components in system  
  
4. Basic implementation of funtional requirements (dsa, explain approach in first 3 lines and then with proper inline comments) 

5. explain how communication happens between key components at scale, availability, consistency (if needed). what services(queues, or http or grpc or anything else) we use between components, implement design patterns if needed.  
  
6. Db tables and schema (if needed)  
  
  
  
Rules: If any code then give in java  
  
System: cache key value
